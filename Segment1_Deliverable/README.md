# DataBootcampFinalProject Segment1 Deliverable

**This is the Segment1 Deliverable for the Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project.**

## Overview

- Topic: Our team will create a NN to determine the 'rating' of chocolate from this kaggle dataset.
- Reason: Because chocolate is *Theobroma - "The food of the gods"*
- Data Source: [Kaggle Chocolate Bar Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings)
- Questions we want to answer:
    - Can we predict which chocolate bars will have a rating of >= 4.0 based on
        - Bean Type
        - Cocoa Percent
        - Review date
    - **Other questions?**

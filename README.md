# DataBootcampFinalProject

## Beginning - Please do not use yet

This repo will change soon, because I think I didn't set it up right.
But I pushed out my initial jupyter notebook code so other team members can see what I did before we really get started.
All my stuff is in the Bruce/chocolate_bar_ratings subdir.

You can read & run the jupyter notebook code, but please don't check anything back into the repo until I get it set up "the right way" according to the instructions. I'll delete this stuff from the repo in the process (but will eventually put it in the right place).

Thanks

The current dir structure is like this:

	README.md - the file you are reading now
	Bruce/
		README.md - empty
		.gitignore - don't push unecessary files/dirs from Tensorflow / Keras:
						checkpoints/
						checkpoints_opt/
						untitled_project/
		chocolate_bar_ratings/
			archive.zip - the original zip file from kaggle
			checkpoints_opt/ - lots of checkpoint files every time you run
			ChocolateBarRatings.ipynb - the jupyter notebook code
			ChocoloateBarRatings_opt1.h5 - the saved NN model
			flavors_of_cacao.csv - a slightly modified csv file from the zip
	Tahereh/
		README.md - empty
	Travis/
		README.md - empty
	Yan/
		README.md - empty

To run the code:

$ cd Bruce/chocolate_bar_ratings
$ jupyter notebook - then open/run ChocolateBarRatings.ipynb
